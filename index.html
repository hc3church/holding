                    <p class="custom-card">The Bible describes God's love as being longer, wider, higher and deeper than we can imagine. And it's a journey of discovery that we are all on. It's the kind of love that sent Jesus to become our Saviour. It's the kind of love that cares about the ordinary challenges of life.</p>
